# spam-bot

this spam bot is made in python, and once you download the spam bot you would open this in your own IDE, and after that you install pyautogui on the IDE you are on, once that you can change the text 'HALO IDRIS' to anything you want. then this will auto enter the text you just wrote. if you dont want to auto enter then you could just delete the line (pyautogui.press('enter'))
